# AI Development Workflow Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete AI development workflow, including problem definition, data collection, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, deployment, and ethical considerations. The assignment is organized into clearly separated folders for the report, code, and diagrams.

## Folder Structure
```
report/                  # Contains the main PDF report
code/                    # Contains all code files (preprocessing, model, evaluation)
diagrams/                # Contains the workflow diagram image
README.md                # Project overview and instructions
.gitignore               # Files/folders to ignore in Git
```

## How to Run the Code
1. Navigate to the `code/` directory.
2. Run the scripts in order:
   - `preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses the data.
   - `model_dev.py`: Trains and saves the model.
   - `evaluation.py`: Evaluates the model and outputs metrics.
3. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebook version for interactive exploration.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes
- The main report is in `report/AI_Development_Workflow_Assignment.pdf`.
- The workflow diagram is in `diagrams/workflow_diagram.png`.
- All code is well-commented for clarity.
