# AI for Sustainable Development: CO₂ Emissions Prediction (SDG 13)

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to forecast CO₂ emissions for countries, supporting SDG 13: Climate Action. By predicting future emissions, policymakers can make informed decisions to combat climate change.

## Dataset
- World Bank CO₂ Emissions
- World Bank Economic Indicators

## Approach
- Supervised learning (regression)
- Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn

## Steps
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Ethical reflection

## Results
- Model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Visualizations of predictions

## Ethical Reflection
- Discusses data bias, fairness, and sustainability impact

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter and follow the steps.
